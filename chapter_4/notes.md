Notes and links related to chapter 4:

* The chapter mentions that most programming languages' syntax can be represented by a context-free grammar (CFG). I'm not sure that's really true. This is a grammar for 2011 standard C, but I think it's not context-free: http://www.quut.com/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html
* Discussion about how ambiguities in Ruby syntax make it difficult to parse or represent with a compact grammar: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5182864
* Supposedly Lisp is very simple to represent with a grammar—maybe because the syntax is close to the AST—but I didn't find a good example Lisp grammar in my quick search.
